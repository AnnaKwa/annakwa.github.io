Hello! I am currently an Insight Data Fellow Fellow in Seattle, WA.
I recently received my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://physics.uci.edu">UC Irvine Department of Physics and Astronomy</a>, where I was a NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying theoretical astro-particle physics. I started this website as way of documenting my progress as I work to improve upon my statistics / data science / coding skills. See <a href="http://annakwa.github.io/blog"> my blog on this page</a> if you're curious about some of the side projects I've worked on (might be out of date).
</p>


	<p>My research focused on using astrophysical and cosmological observations to probe the particle nature of dark matter. If you're interested in my research work, check out <a href="http://annakwa.github.io/research">this bit of my page</a> that describes some of the stuff I've worked on as a graduate student. </p>

<p>
I also enjoy helping students of all ages get excited about physics and the Universe through teaching and outreach programs. I've put some of my education materials on the <a href="http://annakwa.github.io/education">education and outreach section of this site</a>. </p>
