Hello! I am currently a graduate student studying theoretical astro-particle physics in the [UC Irvine Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://physics.uci.edu). I started this blog as way of documenting my progress as I work to improve upon my statistics / data science / coding skills. If you're interested in my research work, check out [my research  website](http://localgroup.ps.uci.edu/akwa) or [my publication list](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/A.Kwa.1).
